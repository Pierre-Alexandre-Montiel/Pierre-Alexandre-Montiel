### Hi there 👋

Currently in professional retraining, I joined 42 to improve my skills in the main computer languages and increase my expertise. 

- 🥷🏻 I am currently working as a SOC analyst at ProBTP => Qradar as SIEM (IBM cyber attack management solution)
- 🌱 Commonly used languages: C/C++/Javascript/Typescript/Python/Django => Main stacks used Vuejs for front-end and Nestjs for back-end
- 👨‍💻 Good basics in docker, docker-compose, heroku, Postgresql and MongoDB
- 🎮 I love working on back-end projects by myself and would like to make it a professional goal
